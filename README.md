Learning Github while having fun on a gravel bike
-----

In rugged terrains where gravel roars,
Adventure awaits, behind nature's doors.
Dusty trails weave 'neath the boundless sky,
Whispering secrets as the world flies by.

Beneath knobby tires, the earth unfolds,
A wild canvas, where stories are told.
Mountains stand tall, rivers rush along,
Inviting the bold with a siren song.

Through forests dense and open plains,
Gravel biking, where freedom reigns.
Each turn, a challenge, a thrill to seize,
A symphony of motion, the soul's release.

Up steep ascents, the challenge calls,
Heartbeats sync with the waterfall's falls.
Down descents, adrenaline sparks,
The wind's wild embrace, where courage embarks.

In this fusion of speed and wild terrain,
Adventures bloom, free from constraint's chain.
Gravel biking, an untamed delight,
Where every journey fuels the soul's flight.

So, let the wheels roll, let spirits ignite,
Gravel biking, an odyssey's invite.
In every trail, a story untamed,
An adventurous spirit, forever unchained.

with love, ChatGPT
